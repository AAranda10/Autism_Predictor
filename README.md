# Autism Predictor

### Author: Austin Aranda

## Description: 

The purpose of this project is to develop a model that is able to predict whether a toddler would potentially be diagnosed with Autism. In being able to predict whether a child could potentially have Autism or not, medical providers would be able to more proactively get children the help they need at a younger age. This model could be further developed with more data and feedback from healthcare specialists in the Autism field. 

In addition, I have provided these deliverables:

    1. Visual of Findings
    
    2. Prep.py and MVP_model.py file to recreate my efforts.
    
    3. Presentation with the results of my findings.

## Project Planning

Initial Questions:
- Is there a certain age range where it's easier to detect Autism in a child?
- Is there a variance based on survey scores?
- Does a child's ethnicity or race play a role?
- What questions are better at predicting Autism in a child?


### Hypotheses:

#### 1st Hypothesis

𝐻 0 - There is no difference in survey scores between children with Autism and all children tested

𝐻 a - There is a difference in survey scores between children with Autism and all children tested

#### 2nd Hypothesis

𝐻 0 - A child having Autism is independent of type of having family history of Autism

𝐻 a - A child having Autism is not independent of type of having family history of Autism

#### 3rd Hypothesis

𝐻 0 - Sex of child is independent of child having Austism

𝐻 a - Sex of child is not independent of child having Autism
